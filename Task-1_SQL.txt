Query 1: Calculate number of users registered in Finland in the last 30 days

SELECT COUNT(*) AS finland_users_last_30_days
FROM Users
WHERE User_country = 'Finland'
  AND User_registration_timestamp_utc >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);



Query 2: Count the number of users who have made at least one purchase in the past 30 days, where their purchases include more than one unique product

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.User_id) AS users_with_multiple_products
FROM Sales s
JOIN Purchases p ON s.Purchase_id = p.Purchase_id
WHERE s.Timestamp_utc >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
GROUP BY s.User_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.Product_id) > 1;

Query 3: Retrieve the most recent price for each purchased product
Method-1
SELECT 
    p1.Product_id,
    p1.Price AS most_recent_price
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Sales s1 ON p1.Purchase_id = s1.Purchase_id
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        p.Product_id,
        MAX(s.Timestamp_utc) AS latest_timestamp
    FROM Purchases p
    JOIN Sales s ON p.Purchase_id = s.Purchase_id
    GROUP BY p.Product_id
) latest ON p1.Product_id = latest.Product_id AND s1.Timestamp_utc = latest.latest_timestamp;

Method-2 

WITH RankedPurchases AS (
    SELECT 
        Product_id,
        Price,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Product_id ORDER BY Timestamp_utc DESC) AS rn
    FROM Purchases p
    JOIN Sales s ON p.Purchase_id = s.Purchase_id
)
SELECT 
    Product_id,
    Price AS most_recent_price
